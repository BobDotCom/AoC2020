# Advent of Code Solutions
These are the solutions I came up with for [AoC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). Feel free to comment if you found a better way to do them. Will be updated frequently until Dec. 25, 2020.
## Warning
This contains solutions to AoC 2020, if you do not wish to see them, close this window now.
## How to use
Just git clone this repo and add the `solution.final()` function to main.py. You replace day with the day number. For example `solution1.final()` or `solution17.final()`. My inputs are included, but you can replace them with yours if you want. For obvious reasons, the corresponding function for each day of the month will only be released on/after that day.
## Why am I getting warnings?
Your IDE may give you some warnings, this is normal, nothing you can do about it. Further explained in the main.py file.
## Why is the solution for today not posted?
To make it fair for everyone involved in the event, I will not post my solutions until the day after, for example day 6 solution will be posted on day 7.
